# whichvlm

Find local vision-language models that fit your machine.

`whichvlm` detects GPU, CPU, RAM, Apple Metal/MLX readiness, model formats, quantized variants, GGUF projectors, and model lineage. It ranks VLM candidates for local inference instead of treating every Hugging Face repo as one plain text model.

## Install

Use Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/Github/whichvlm
uv sync
uv run whichvlm --help
```

For editable development with test dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run pytest -q
```

## Use

Rank VLMs for the current machine:

```bash
uv run whichvlm
```

Simulate Apple Silicon or a discrete GPU:

```bash
uv run whichvlm --gpu "Apple M3 Max"
uv run whichvlm --gpu "RTX 4090" --vram-headroom 10%
uv run whichvlm --gpu "RTX 4090" --perf-vram 10%
```

Return machine-readable output:

```bash
uv run whichvlm --json --top 5
```

Change the VLM workload estimate:

```bash
uv run whichvlm --image-count 2 --image-size 896 --context-length 8192
```

Reserve memory for backend overhead or performance features:

```bash
uv run whichvlm --gpu "RTX 4090" --vram-headroom auto --perf-vram 10%
uv run whichvlm plan Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --perf-vram 10%
uv run whichvlm hardware-plan "RTX 4090" --perf-vram 10%
uv run whichvlm upgrade "RTX 4090" "RTX 5090" --perf-vram 10%
```

Only show full GPU fits:

```bash
uv run whichvlm --gpu-only
uv run whichvlm --fit full-gpu
```

## Run A Model

VLM runners require an image path.

```bash
uv run whichvlm run Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --image ./image.jpg --max-tokens 256
uv run whichvlm snippet Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --image ./image.jpg --context-length 8192
```

For vLLM and SGLang, derive backend memory utilization from the same reserve:

```bash
uv run whichvlm run Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --backend vllm --perf-vram 10% --image ./image.jpg
uv run whichvlm serve Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct --backend sglang --gpu-memory-utilization 0.82
```

Runtime support is intentionally guarded:

- Transformers VLMs use `AutoProcessor` and image/text chat templates.
- GGUF VLMs require a concrete GGUF file plus an `mmproj` or projector artifact.
- MLX VLMs require a concrete MLX model package.
- Text-only GGUF and Transformers paths remain available for inherited core behavior.

## What It Models

`whichvlm` tracks a VLM as a package graph:

- `ModelArtifact`: repo, file format, quantization, access, backend support, source kind, filename.
- `ModelComponent`: language tower, vision encoder, projector, processor, tokenizer, merged checkpoint, adapter.
- `ModelLineage`: base models, merged parents, variant relation, and fused/merged status.

The ranker is VLM-aware but conservative. Vision memory includes language weights, KV cache, activation memory, estimated vision encoder/projector overhead, image-token expansion, and prefill scratch. These estimates are useful for ranking. They are not final benchmark-quality measurements.

## Data Sources

Model metadata comes from Hugging Face API queries, local cache, and curated VLM seeds.

The fetcher prioritizes:

- `image-text-to-text`
- `visual-question-answering`
- `image-to-text`
- GGUF, MLX, AWQ, GPTQ, BNB, and FP8 variants
- text-generation only as backbone or variant discovery

Benchmark evidence is graded as direct, variant, base model, interpolated, self-reported, or absent. Vision scores lead the `vision` and `ocr` profiles. Text benchmarks are fallback evidence.

## Development

Run the full suite:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
```

Run focused tests:

```bash
uv run pytest -q tests/test_runtime.py tests/test_fetcher.py tests/test_ranker.py
```

Compile-check source and tests:

```bash
uv run python -m compileall -q src tests
```

The source layout is under `src`. Tests live under `tests`. Avoid importing private CLI helpers in new tests; prefer runtime, ranker, fetcher, or output APIs.

## Real Hardware Benchmarks

These use real hardware, downloads, and runtime dependencies.

Run the same detection benchmark on every target machine:

```bash
uv run python benchmarks/real_hardware.py detection --expect-backend metal
```

Run the same GGUF+mmproj VLM benchmark on every target machine:

```bash
uv run python benchmarks/real_hardware.py gguf-mmproj \
  --repo owner/model-gguf \
  --model-file model-q4_k_m.gguf \
  --mmproj-file mmproj-model-f16.gguf \
  --handler Llava16ChatHandler \
  --image ./image.jpg
```

## Current Limits

The model inventory is not complete.

Multimodal benchmark calibration is not final.

GGUF VLM and MLX VLM runners are only as reliable as the concrete artifacts and runtime handlers discovered for a model package.

ANE is detected as information only. It is not scored until there is a concrete VLM runtime path.
